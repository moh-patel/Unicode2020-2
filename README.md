# UniCode-20-21

Welcome to my UniCode 2020 repository. 
Across 13 challenges, 80+ UK based Universities battle it out head-to-head to try and finish in the top 5 of their league, earning their spot at the ultimate coding battle finale.

In this repo I have included my solutions to the challenges I have attempted

## :red_car:  How Long is it?

There is a total of 13 challenges to complete, each one taking no more than an hour to complete. 
A challenge is open for 2 weeks and only your first submission will count for scoring.

## :rocket:  How you win?

Each coder can contribute points towards their University by completing a challenge. 
The team with the highest points (taken from the top 10 individual scores) will win the fixture and obtain 3 points.

## :trophy: The Grande Finale

The top 10 coders from each of the 5 Universities in each league will battle it out in the Unicode 20/21 Grand Finale to claim top spot.
Don’t worry, you can still qualify for the individual finale if your team doesn’t make it
